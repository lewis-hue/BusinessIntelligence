## Data Analysis in Databricks

In this analysis, we are looking at various metrics for a set of customers to understand patterns related to `TotalPurchase`, `Frequency`, and `Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)`.

### Total Revenue generated by Product

#### Analysis:
The bar graph above visualizes the relationship between `CustomerID` and `TotalPurchase`. It shows how much each customer has spent, providing a direct way to assess high-spending customers.

#### Business Implication:
- Companies can use this information to identify high-value customers. By focusing on these customers, businesses can tailor marketing campaigns to increase loyalty and repeat purchases.
- Offering targeted incentives, such as discounts or personalized deals, could drive more revenue from high-value customers.

### Top-performing Stores by Revenue

#### Analysis:
This bar graph illustrates how frequently each customer makes purchases. Customers with higher frequency may represent loyal buyers.

#### Business Implication:
- Businesses can create loyalty programs or rewards for frequent buyers to keep them engaged.
- Understanding purchasing behavior can help businesses develop retention strategies, leading to a higher lifetime value for each customer.

### Revenue by Country

#### Analysis:
The bar graph displays `Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)` for each customer, which quantifies the total value a customer brings to the business over time.

#### Business Implication:
- High CLV customers are essential for long-term business success. Companies should focus efforts on retaining these customers.
- CLV can also help businesses decide how much to invest in acquiring new customers based on expected returns.

#### Analysis:
The correlation coefficient of 0.81 indicates a strong positive relationship between Frequency and CLV. Customers who purchase more frequently are likely to have higher lifetime value, reflecting the notion that frequent engagement generally leads to longer customer retention and more spending over time.

The p-value of 0.09 is still above the typical threshold of 0.05, which suggests that this correlation is not statistically significant at the 5% level. However, it is very close to being significant, meaning it could still represent a meaningful trend, though more data would be needed for stronger conclusions.
